I plan to run a case to verify the diffusion coefficient of water calculated by MACE potential, by comparing the diffusion coefficient calculated by traditional potential, eg, SPC/E model. The data is the simplified data used in LAMMPS, I just want use it to run the LAMMPS successfully. I updatedâ€¦
